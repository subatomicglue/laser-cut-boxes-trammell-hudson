# Fork of Trammell Hudson's laser scripts

It would appear that at the time of this writing 2021.05.21 that the bitbucket no longer exists for the `boxer.pl`, `lace-maker.pl`, and `circle-maker.pl` scripts refrered by Trammel Hudson's laser cut projects pages:

- https://trmm.net/Boxer/
- https://trmm.net/Voronoi_boxes/

So this is a FORK to preserve the work!

# Install

Install perl modules
- sudo cpan install Math::Geometry::Voronoi
